EntraCP lets you configure various settings through administration pages, or using PowerShell:

- [Add the credentials]({{< relref "set-credentials" >}}) to your Entra ID tenant
- [Configure the proxy]({{< relref "../how-to/configure-proxy" >}})
- Enable / disable the augmentation
- Set the Graph property that identifies the users (members and guests) and the groups
- Customize the display of the permissions

The administration pages can be found in the Central Administration > Security.
