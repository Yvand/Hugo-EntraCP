EntraCP lets you configure many settings through administration pages, or using PowerShell;

- [Add the credentials]({{< relref "set-credentials" >}}) to your Entra ID tenant
- [Set the proxy]({{< relref "docs/how-to/configure-proxy" >}})
- Enable / disable the augmentation
- Customize the display of the permissions
- Customize the claim types

The administration pages can be found in the central administration > Security.
